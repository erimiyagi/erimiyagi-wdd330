        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What did I do since the last meeting?
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  I learned the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by reading a pdf and watching a lesson video on SitePoint. 
                  I created a portfolio page for this course through understanding the instructor's example. 
              </li>
          </ul><br>
          <li>
            What am I going to do next?
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  I am going to prepare the course equipment sufficiently and start learning SQL and PHP to do my assignments smoothly.
              </li>
          </ul><br>
          <li>
            What are my blockers?
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  My blockers will be understanding and coding PHP. Because English is my second language, it takes time to completely understand a new thing in English rather than others. But I know doing my best helps me reach out desired goal.
