                  We had a team meeting Thursday night and discussed what the problems are in the team activity and be given the solutions. Also, we have a slack chat room so that we can communicate easily.

                Not only being helped by others, I should also support them. I'm not good at JaveScript, but reading a lot of the materials will give me a best solution for me and others.

                Our team meets Thursday night in the MST, but it is Friday morning in my timezone and I am supposed to take a train to work. I will move to a place where it is near to my office. So, it should be solved in two weeks.
